This repository contains the MATLAB code used to generate the figures in the manuscript found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04524 that show the evolution of density matrix elements (at the ensemble level).

This is achieved by integrating the Unified Quantum Master Equation (Phys Rev A, 103, 062226, 2021) both directly (numerically), and using the approximate "LEPE" method (Phys Rev E, 108, 014130, 2023). This is done for the two-level system and a three-level "V" system.

In the code, the initial state of the system must be specified as well as the numerical values of all parameters.
